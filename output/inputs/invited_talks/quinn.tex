Knowledge workers are crying out for ways to industrialised the boring parts of their jobs, company executives are looking for ways to get a computer to replace all the humans and everyone thinks an LLM will solve all of their problems. But how do we ensure that we aren’t creating a catastrophic failure when we deploy LLMs in situations where we can’t afford to fail?

In this keynote, I will explore some of the issues we need to contend with when we put LLMs and other language technologies into an enterprise. I will touch on data preprocessing, governance, user trust and interpretation.
